        <h2> Challenges and Learning </h2> 
        <p> One of the biggest challenges that our group faced was the loss of members during the project. The major project was designed to be done with 6 members, however under unforeseen circumstances, 3 members left in the middle of the semester, making it difficult for our group members to split up our work. Other challenges we faced included finding a time to work together (hold meetings) and finishing work in a timely manner together. Holding meetings were generally alright, however there were a few times where our group had difficulty setting up a time.</p>
        
        <p> Holding meetings were really beneficial for our team, we were able to work together efficiently and would not waste time in our meetings. This was after so many members had left our group, and thus rapport was slowly being built between the last of us. With the more established roles in our group, in Assignment 3 we were able to assign roles clearly and were able to get started sooner than our other assignments.</p>
        
        <p> The workload of this project we found out to be quite the struggle, with group members leaving abruptly, our workload had doubled and as none of us have ever done an assignment to this scale, we all found it difficult to adapt to doing it amongst this pandemic. Our motivation for projects and university were at an all time low, however we managed to pull through and get our work done on time. Many times we would find ourselves having trouble with particular aspects of our work, the biggest struggle with this was that we would find these too late and close to the submission deadline. To prevent this in our future work, we would be asking our tutor and/or lecturer much sooner so that we can have time to get feedback and work on it. One of our biggest struggles when starting this project was finding an initial idea to work on. It was one thing to have an idea, but it was a completely different issue when it came to building that idea, as we as a group did not have much experience or skills to create anything elaborate. On top of this, our group members all had the mindset of ‘I don’t mind what we do’ and that got us nowhere. From this we have learnt that it’s better to have someone just step up and make the decisions for us. </p>
        
        <p> Unexpected issues that our group had encountered were mostly around the loss of members. We didn’t know that they would be leaving until about halfway through assignment 2. This delayed a lot of our work as we had already assigned roles to members when we had 6 people. There were some roles that we were waiting on in the group so that the rest of us could continue our work, but it wasn’t until after the group member had left that we realised that there was no work being done in that role, and so we had to step into that role and take over that aspect. </p>
        
        <p> Our group has been stretched by the onset of double the workload when members left. Other things that have been when our group would have to set up meetings. Setting them up would take a bit of time initially due to our different schedules with work and uni, however we managed to at least get in one meeting each week. In our meetings there was a big stepping stone where we went from having really quiet meetings where they would drag on for a long time as no one would say anything, however after the group got smaller, we were a lot more proactive in trying to talk to each other to get work done quickly. This led to us building a positive rapport with each other and made it easier for us to ask for help with one another.</p>
        
        <p> Things we expected going into this project included the difficulty of this work. From the beginning our group had been hesitant about the work as we were unsure if we would be able to implement our project successfully. With this in mind, our group was reassuring ourselves that the project itself was one aspect, but the quality of how we present our work is another part of it.</p>
        
        <p> To combat the challenges our group faced, we decided to split up the tasks and tried to coordinate collaboration where we could. This worked initially with about two members working on one particular aspect, however with the loss of members it turned into each member having a specific task each. We still continued to try and split up the work evenly as much as we could.</p>
        
        <p> Our group has come a long way in terms of developing new skills. Prior to this project, not many of us were able to code anything major and we all had a very basic understanding of coding in Java/HTML/CSS, however over the course of the project, we have learnt how to develop a basic application, even if it isn’t 100% functional. Other skills that we have developed include how to do non technical things, such as pitching an application and how to build an application that would be considered in this modern world with many other apps on the market. The creation of our websites are also a new addition to our skills as not all of us have had a comprehensive understanding of how to develop a website from scratch. Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) has taught us how to organise our work in a way that it will work effectively in a group setting.</p>
        
        <p> Initially we had planned to split up our tasks and our work to cater for 6 people, however we had to quickly change that to accommodate 3, but since that didn’t work out as easily as we hoped, we still stuck with what we had, except the workload would double for each member instead. We had to assign roles for each group member once we had lost half of our group, so that it was easier to just allocate certain tasks to certain members.  The timeline we had initially set out, had been changed completely, upon getting feedback from Dr. B and Ivan, we realised that our plan had to be changed up and could not stay the same as they were, as it would not make sense.  Our MVFs changed a little bit as we were changing things from 6 members to 3 (in assignment 3). The change in how we would go about some of our MVFs changed as we started to prototype them, so that the MVF would make more sense and work better.</p>
        
        <p> Aspects of our project that we would change next time if we were to work together as a team again would include assigning roles from the very beginning, so that we would work quickly through this all and not have a delayed start.</p>
        
        <p> Not much has turned out as we have expected, there were definitely a lot of things we did not anticipate for in terms of workload and how in depth our work needed to be to be considered at a high standard.</p>
        
        <p> We would change our timetable from having set dates to having set hours instead. If possible, creating a Gantt chart would have helped our group immensely as it would allow us all to see what work we needed from each member to be done so that the next task (member) can get started.</p>
        
        <p> Allocating more time to each task would be beneficial for our group as it would allow us to spend more time working on specific tasks and getting them done earlier on. If we have leftover time, it would be better than having not enough time. </p>
        
        <p> We had issues with AWS in our second assignment, as when we were creating our website, there was an issue of our CSS not updating, due it being conflicting with our old CSS sheet from assignment 1. This was then solved by recreating folders so that our work would all be in a separate place from our assignment 1 HTML &amp; CSS.</p>
        
        <p> We had issues with people not being able to access GITHUB at first too, the one that was created in our first group was created as private, so then our assignment 1 marks were unable to be processed (in regards to our GITHUB). In assignment 2, we had to create a new GITHUB halfway through, as we had the member that created it, leave our course and group. The GITHUB was unable to be seen/found as a result of this, hence creating the new GITHUB (this time public + able to be accessed).</p>
        
        <p> Trello was confusing for us all to use, as we have never used it before. It created difficulties in both using it and remembering to use it and update it, our group had to consistently remind each other that we needed to update our tasks.</p>
        
        <p> The risks we have materialised include, ‘personal information accidentally opened on device’. We have resolved this issue by creating a two step process for users to get into the application, one is by putting in the user’s passcode, and the second is by logging into their account. Another one of our risks was ‘unable to identify the problem that the user is going through’. By creating a ‘resources’ tab in our application, users can head there to find more professional help from nearby sources, whether it be online or in person. This is to accommodate for as many users as possible.</p>
        
        <p> The biggest unanticipated event in our project was losing group members and it was our biggest event that we had that affected the rest of our group.</p>
        
        <p> Another unanticipated event was that we were very unsure of how to go about creating this application, however we were able to overcome it by talking to our tutor and Dr B to find a common ground of what we can use to create our project.</p>
