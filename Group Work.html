        <h3>Estimation Plan</h3>
        <p> 
            Our group's estimation plan had started off solid, however over the course of the assignment, our planned times were all over the place. We had half of our members leave our course and we were left with 3 members left. Initially the plan was to finish two MVFs a week, this worked initially and things were looking good. When we had 6 members, the roles were split up into 'main programmer'; the person who was in charge of finding us a platform to work off of to create our application, 'designer'; the people who were in charge of designing our application to make it presentable and 'process designer'; the people who were in charge of prototyping the designs to make them actually function. With these roles, we had 1 person be a main programmer, 2 people as designers and 2 people as process designers (this was when we had only 1 person leave our course). Instead as 2 other people in our group leave, role were moved around and instead the three of us had mixed roles. 1 person moved into the main programmer's role and then all 3 members ended up doing each role for the MVFs, this was when we assigned different MVFs to each other to cover more area and get more work done. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Unfortunately our group did not keep up with our estimated due dates, and this was when we assigned separate MVFs to each other to work on. This was all given until the last week to finish. Each member was in charge of their own area to develop it, Sumeet worked on getting our intial designs in place so that we had something to work off of. After he had created the first screen for our MVFs, William and Jenny proceeded to work on most of them to get them to be functional. This was all done through Figma as a group.

        <h3>Technologies and Architecture</h3>
        
        <p>
            Our group had a few different options that we would create our application on. The options were Figma, Marvel (app creator) and Eclipse (using Java knowledge from a course we had all already completed), our group had decided to use Figma as we had all already used it in the past, or at least have heard of it from our previous courses. Another pushing factor to turning to Figma was that as a group, none of us were completely confident in any other method to code the application.
