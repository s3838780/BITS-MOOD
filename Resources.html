        <p> Users press the button with three lines on the bottom right corner of the screen and then press on the button labeled 'Resources' to access the main 'Resources' screen. From there, users can access three different types of assistance, being details on professional help, support groups, and direct access to a mental health professional. </p>
        <p>Under the details of the professional help users can see information like what do specific professionals help with, when can they be seen, how can you contact them. Support groups would information like what support groups are local and what sort of issues can they help with. The direct access to the mental health professional would allow a user to directly contact a professional in case of sudden or immediate needs for help.
