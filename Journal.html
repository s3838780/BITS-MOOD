        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p> Users click on the '+' button to open up the option of adding a journal or a reminder. Users can click on journal and it brings up the option to add in a manual entry or get given questions. The questions are given as the same quesetions each time to allow consistency for the journal. In the manual entry, users are able to attach images and other media to add onto their journal. After the user has filled out their journal entry, they can then submit the entry and it will be added to the calendar. The journal entry can be found by clicking on the date that the user wants to look at, and then clicking 'Open Journal'
        </p>
        
        <p>The example shown below is of a user that wants to create a journal entry about their day during COVID-19's lockdown period. The user follows the steps (listed above) and inputs their entry. </p>
