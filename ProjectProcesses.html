        <h2> Project Processes </h2> 
        <p> Main aspects that contribute to a successful group project include clear communication between all group members, especially when there are any issues that arise. Organising each other in a way that works well for a group is a key factor in this, when we started our course everyone was quiet and reluctant to take lead. One member of our group stepped up to take lead initially and it worked out really well, however soon after, the member that took lead unfortunately left the course. At this point our group was back to square one where everyone was just going along with what each other said. It wasn’t until two other group members had left (leaving us with 3 people) for our group to realise someone had to just step up and take lead, and it really helped our group out with getting work done and staying on top of work. There were times where some of our group members were unable to communicate with the rest of the team due to an enrolment error, however we overcame this as they managed to email us through other means.</p>
        
        <p> Time management was a really important factor for our group, we all had really differing schedules and a lot of our work was unable to get done in the initial time frame we aimed for. Where there was a delay in communication, there was a delay in our work being produced.</p>
        
        <p> A big thing about group projects is holding up your end of the work, if you don’t hold up your end, other group members will not be motivated to either, and there is no point waiting around to see what someone else is done to get started, because it is better to have down some work that you can do to your best ability first, even if it’s wrong, because you can always fix it up afterwards/later on after seeing what everyone else has done. Most of the time your group members will feel like you if you are scared to talk or submit any work, like if you are worried that the work you put up is not ‘good enough’, the problem will not be the work itself, because if there is a problem, your other group members will try to help you get on the right track, there is no need to be scared of doing the work ‘wrong’. Things that have worked well in our group is that we have been able to communicate in our meetings well to delegate tasks to each other, however things that have not been going so well is the amount of communication we have between meetings. Towards the end of each assignment, everyone will start to talk more because they know the due date is the next day, however throughout the time from the start of the assignment being released to 3 days before the due date, many of us would not do the work on time and it would be often because we are unsure on how to do it. In the last 3 days, most of the conversations are asking for help on how to do things, which did not work well in our favour because that is when we would have a lot of stress built up (upon having other assignments to work on). </p>
        
        <p> Throughout our project, we were able to communicate with our tutor and lecturers for any assistance, and we did do this, however in all honesty our group did not use this to our full advantage. </p>
