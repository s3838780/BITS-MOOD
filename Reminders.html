        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p> Users click on the '+' button to create a new reminder. The screen that opens will give users the option to create a new journal entry or a reminder. Reminders can be customised so that the user can categorise it with different colours. These colours show up on the calendar to easily identify the reminder that the user has put in. When the user opens a specific date on the calendar, they are given their reminder and the option to open their journal. Once the reminder is completed, users can click 'Complete' for it to be done. Alternatively, if the user has not finished the task yet, they can click 'Decline' and the reminder will stay there. The most urgent (closest due date) reminder will show on the user's home screen so that they can quickly access it when opening the application.
