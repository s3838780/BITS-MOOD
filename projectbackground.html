        <h3> The Idea</h3>
        <!-- try to use h3 for sub headings to keep the website consistent! -->
        <p> The project idea is a mental health web based application. Our group's name was formed after deciding what sort of application we would be building. The team's name is 'Mood', we found this fitting as the aim of our application is to help users
            understand and improve their mood.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Purpose</h3>
        <p>The use of this application is to assist those who are experiencing troubling times and need an outlet to express their emotions where they can call their personal 'safe space'. The application entails features that are designed to help a person
            overcome their everyday struggles with simple yet effective tasks. The application's functions include a daily journal, reminders, strategies to cope and many resources to go to if any severe attention is required. The application is designed
            to have a few elements of ‘fun’ by creating a point system to motivate the user and small minigames to help the user take a break when things turn bad. </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>The way that the application will run is through a web based application. The user will be able to sign up to the application and then with these login details, users can keep track of their progress and inputs in the overview section. All data
            that is stored on the application will be encrypted so that only the user (and anyone that they permit) can see any of the data that the user has put into the application. The journal section of the application is designed to create a safe
            space for the user to write about anything from an in depth novel of how their day went, to simple questions about their day. The application will give the user two options, one to manually enter their own journal entry and the other to answer
            a few questions on how their day went. The reminders are a simple checklist that can be enabled/disabled by the user. By default there will be reminders such as 'Eat breakfast', 'Meditate', etc which the user can keep or change easily. The
            notification for the reminders will come through to the user's device (if enabled). Within the app, there will be an area that is a 'go to' spot for when the user needs a coping strategy. For example the user is feeling overwhelmed and would
            like to find a way to cope with how they're feeling, the user can go to the 'Coping Strategies' of the application and search for their symptoms and be recommended different techniques. In the event that there are no techniques available to
            help a user, they will then be redirected to a resource to go to for professional help. Each of our minimum viable features will have their own section (except encryption, as it is used overall).</p>

            <p> My name is Sumeet and I am a first year student at rmit university. In my high school years I developed the interest in working with technology and decided to pursue it. I have keen interest in cybersecurity but also like web developing and
                artificial intelligence. In future i would like to work in one of these fields I am somewhat good with HTML and CSS but not very good at it. I am also good at time management and complete my work on time. I am weak in programming even
                though I have a good interest in it. I would like to work with my teammates and develop a great project and like to give my full to the work I am assigned to.

            <h2> Jenny Nguyen s3838780</h2>
            <p>My name is Jenny, I’m a first-year student straight out of high school and I like the idea of working in the IT industry. I don’t have a set path on where I would want my career to go yet, however, I am interested in working in cybersecurity
                and/or artificial intelligence in the future. My passion for IT started with playing computer games from a young age and being interested in anything that was digital. As I’ve gotten older, my appreciation for how technology has helped
                shape the world and how all types of technologies play a huge part in our daily lives has made me want to work in a field where I can be part of a group that makes the world a better/safer place with new technologies. I often like to help
                out by organising things that others would like to get done, however my interests in projects mainly lie within the coding aspect and the presentation/appearance of a project. I prefer to follow others and help create things with them
                where I can. My technical skills include basic HTML, CSS and Java however they are all of a basic understanding. I would not consider myself very creative, I do like to make things look nice however my actual creativity is very dependent
                on opinions from other group members. I find programming quite difficult, however, I would like to work on these skills. I expect to be working alongside the team to produce a great project that will help develop our skills in IT.

            <h2> William Max Aubrey s3758618
            </h2>
            <p> I have had an interest in IT since I first took it in High School. The actual understanding of how technology works and interconnects is what interested me the most. That interest followed me throughout my schooling and is what encouraged
                me to take on IT in university. I started with a bachelor of computer science degree before realising it wasn’t for me and swapping to a bachelor of IT degree. I am personally interested in a lot of different areas of IT, such as the general
                idea of how different pieces of technology work. I am good at organization and getting groups to work together. I am generally not great at leading groups, in discussions or group planning, so I would prefer to not be in these sorts of
                roles. However, if I were to be in these roles it would be a good opportunity to improve my skills. I can generally perform in any role, being versatile and doing whatever it is I am asked to do. So if there are any areas lacking that
                need more people to work on it I would gladly help out there.

            <h2>AIM AND GOALS -</h2>

            <p>The aim of the project is to make mental health support easier for everyone. In today’s world everyone is so hectic in their life that most of the people suffer from depression, anxiety and Schizophrenia. And people don’t have time in their
                busy lives to go and see the Psychiatrist and their therapist. So by making mental health support easier for everyone will have a huge impact on people’s life and make their mental health more good than before. By making mental health
                easier many people could be benefited from it. They can reduce their stress and reduce their anxiety and depression. <br> In order to achieve the Aim we have to achieve the smaller goals first that are :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To create an environment that allows users to be safe and comfortable to access mental health:-<br> First the team has to create the environment that the user can trust. Team will first talk to them about how they feel on a
                            regular basis for a few days so they can know they can tell the problems to them that they cannot share with another person and do not have to feel judged while telling them. Also the user will be provided with the contract
                            by the team which will ensure them that their secrets and privacy is safe. By this way they can trust us and we would be able to create an environment that will allow them to be safe and comfortable.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Allow ease of access to support staff for mental health:- <br>Making sure who ever uses the app can have regular talk about any problems they're having. So they can know that they can talk about anything at any time about what
                            they are feeling with the professionals. Users are provided with features where they talk with professionals. By doing so they know that they have someone to talk with about anything at any time by which they can reduce their
                            stress. This is a goal as it will help us to achieve the Aim. This can be achieved using the resources section of the app and the user can chat to the doctors through it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Allow for 24/7 support from the medical staff:-<br>The team will provide 24/7 support to the user so that they can get the help anytime they want even at midnight. This way they can help to reduce their stress and feel less anxiety.
                            By this, we will get the help to achieve our aim. This can be achieved by using breaking down coping strategies features of the app.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Giving the sense of achievement and happiness:-<br>When the users do the tasks written in reminders, journal or given by the professionals they earn points. And when the points earned are reached the given points users can buy
                            the things or choose to go to the places in free that are associated with the app and written in the point system feature of the app. By this the user gets the sense of achievement and joy. Thus, helping in achieving the aim.
