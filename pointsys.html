        <h2>POINT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p> The point system is the general way to reward the user to continue to progress toward their goal. When the user completes tasks such as using their reminders or using their journal, they receive points to recognize their progress. The user would
            access this feature by whenever they would use other features they would receive points For example:
            <br>For setting and acknowledging reminders
            <br>Using the journal feature
            <br>Filling out a lot of information on the journal
            <br> They can then go to another screen to see how many points they have accumulated
            <br>When at the points screen, the user will have a choice to spend them at a nearby cafe or at a library/gain access to books from sponsors of the app. These books will be mental health/mindful books.
